# Soil Correction

This project is part of a joint effort with [Instituto de Desenvolvimento Rural do Paraná - IDR](http://www.idrparana.pr.gov.br). 

This project is a case study for undergraduates enrolled in the Software Architecture course at [Universidade Tecnológica Federal do Paraná - Cornélio Procópio](http://www.utfpr.edu.br/campus/cornelioprocopio). We use project based learning to build the software architecture. 

## PROJECT OVERVIEW

The project consists of determining: (i) ideal nutrient values for two soil types; (ii) the needed quantity of phosphor, potassium, calcium & magnesium; (iv) the total cost of each nutrient needed; (v) additional nutrients necessary, based on the nutrient source used. 

Current nutrient values are identified from a laboratory analysis of soil samples. These values are used as input for determining the elements aforementioned.

Currently, IDR uses a spreadsheet to determining the values they need. The goal is to replace the spreadsheet with a cloud native software system.

### As of June, 2021

About 30 students worked on this project in its first cycle, started in March, 2021. During this period, students learned on the impact of development principles on software architecture. They mainly practiced DRY and SOLID principles. They understood how modern programming language constructs can facilitate the archicture maintenance. They used UML to understand each other's architectural structures, focusing on classes (static structure) and message exchange (dynamic structure).

In addition, they practiced software testing, TDD, VCS with Git/Github, and software development with Java.

### As of September, 2021

Less than 15 students actively worked on this project in its second cycle, started in June, 2021. Students learned to visualise static and dynamic components of the architecture by using UML class and sequence diagrams. They exercised Object-Oriented principles, like polymorphism and inheritance by examining the existent architecture. They practiced software reuse by adopting a common Java library. Finally, they used architectural principles to encapsulate classes into layers.
